# What am I trying to achieve?
Two things
1. Cross Domain Cookie sharing in asp.net core to achieve SSO like functionality
2. Containerizing all three apps (authentication, and two sample client apps) using Docker

#make sure your docker engine is running
```
git clone https://github.com/vdonthireddy/dotnet-core-sharing-cookie-auth.git
cd dotnet-core-sharing-cookie-auth/
cd sharing-cookie-auth
bash allrun.sh
```
